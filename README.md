# Front-End Developer (React & Figma to Code Conversion Specialist) - Task
**Project:** Event Management Dashboard

**Objective:**
Convert a Figma design of an event management dashboard into a fully functional, responsive webpage for both web and mobile versions. Only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are requiredâ€”React is not necessary. Dark mode is a bonus. Use placeholder data where needed. The webpage must match the Figma design exactly on both web and mobile without improvisation.

    + Ensure the sidebar becomes a collapsible hamburger menu.
    + Cards, charts, and tables should be responsive and adapt to smaller screens as per the design.
